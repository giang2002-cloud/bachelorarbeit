\section{Overview of SSR Readiness Across the Sample}
\subsubsection{Sample Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This section provides a brief description of the 30 software companies included in the sample, covering:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Geographic distribution
        \item Company size (small, medium, large)
        \item Status of ESG/SSR report disclosure
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Basic Information of Sampled Companies (Appendix A)} 
    \begin{tabular}{l l l l}
        \textbf{Company} & \textbf{Country} & \textbf{Size} & \textbf{Status of ESG \& SSR report disclosure} \\    
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]

    \caption{Sample Classification by Region and Company Size (Appendix B)} 
    
    \begin{tabular}{l l l}
        \textbf{Region/Size} & \textbf{Number of Companies} & \textbf{SSR Readiness Score} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Overall Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SSR readiness scores across the sample range (to be completed with data). 
    \item There is substantial variation in average scores across companies and countries.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]

    \begin{tabular}{l l l}
        \textbf{Company} & \textbf{Score accounding sub-sectors (0-246)} & \textbf{SSR Readiness Score (0-3)} \\

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Readiness by Company Characteristics}
\subsubsection{Comparison of readiness based on:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Company size (SMEs vs. large)
    \item Geographic location (Western vs. Central \& Eastern Europe)
    \item Business model
    \item ESG disclosure status (presence of standalone ESG report)
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Readiness Score by Company Characteristics}
    \begin{tabular}{l l l l}
        \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Number of Companies} & \textbf{Average Readiness} & \textbf{Std. Dev.} \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Analysis by the Framework Categories}
\subsubsection{Readiness across thematic groups}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Readiness by Main Groups (Appendix C)}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Bar Chart of 7 Main Group Readiness (Appendix D)}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Readiness by Mid-Groups}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each main group is further divided into mid-groups, which provide more granular insights into specific reporting areas.
    \item Mid-groups reveal strengths and weaknesses within each thematic category, highlighting areas for improvement.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Readiness by Mid-Groups (Appendix E)}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Bar Chart of Mid-Group Readiness (Appendix F)}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Top and Bottom Reporting Sub-Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify the top 5 sub-criteria with the highest reporting rates
    \item Identify the bottom 5 sub-criteria with the lowest reporting rates
    \item Discuss potential reasons for these patterns, such as ease of measurement, stakeholder demand, or sector norms.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Top 5 Highest and Lowest Reporting Sub-Criteria}
\end{table}

\section{Empirical Drivers and Challenges}

\subsubsection{Key Drivers of Reporting Readiness}
\begin{itemize}
    \item High disclosure rates ($\geq 70\%$) in areas for examples compensation, health \& safety, and DEI 
    suggest these topics are measurable, familiar, and stakeholder-driven â€” thus supporting reporting readiness.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Key Challenges Hindering Reporting Readiness}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Low-scoring criteria (e.g., $<30\%$ disclosure rate) signal inherent challenges.       
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary of Findings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong and weak reporting categories
    \item Factors positively/negatively affecting SSR readiness
    \item Prepares for discussion
