\chapter{THEORETICAL BACKGROUND, PRIOR LITERATURE, AND CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS}

\section{Theoretical frameworks for social sustainability reporting (SSR) readiness in software services}

\subsubsection{1. Opening Paragraph (ca. 1/3 page): Introduction to the role of theory in this research}

Theoretical frameworks provide a foundation for understanding the variation 
in social sustainability reporting (SSR) readiness across software service firms.

\subsubsection{2. Main body paragraphs (ca. 2 page): Overview of key theories}

\vspace{8pt}
\subsubsection{a. Institutional Theory}

Institutional Theory \parencite{DiMaggio1983} explains how external forces such as regulatory mandates (e.g., CSRD, ESRS),
industry norms, and peer behavior exert pressures that influence the motivation of software firms in 
social sustainability reporting.

\subsubsection{b. Resource-Based View (RBV)}

The Resource-Based View \parencite{Barney1991} highlights that SSR readiness depends on a firm's internal capabilities 
and that a lack of such resources may limit readiness even under strong external pressure.

\subsubsection{c. Stakeholder Theory}

Stakeholder Theory \parencite{Freeman1984} views SSR as a strategic response to meet the expectations of key stakeholders.

\subsubsection{3. Closing paragraph (ca. 1/3 page): Integration and relevance to the study}

These theories complement each other by offering distinct yet interconnected explanations of SSR readiness, 
which will serve as analytical tools to interpret empirical results in Chapter 5.

\section{Foundations and Prior Literature on Social Sustainability Reporting}

\subsubsection{Paragraph 1: Overview and Prior Literature on Social Sustainability Reporting}
Social sustainability reporting in this research highlights the S-Pillar in CSR Reporting.
Overview of SSR is presented \parencite{Edge2022,Fiechter2022}, and relevant standards \parencite{Dechow2023} to be 
used in Chapter 3 (CSRD, ESRS, GRI) are defined. Prior research on SSR in software is scarce \parencite{Ye2020,Afshari2022} 
and social disclosures are often weak \parencite{Christensen2021,Reitmaier2024}.

\subsubsection{Paragraph 2: Own Workforce Metrics under ESRS S1: Definitions and Prior Literature}
Under ESRS S1, own workforce covers all employees with a direct contractual relationship to the undertaking. 
Its disclosure requirements span multiple thematic areas.

For this study, 
they are consolidated into seven categories for structured analysis: characteristics, 
collective bargaining and social dialogue, compensation, training, health and safety, work-life balance, and human rights.

Prior Literature: e.g. Key own-workforce aspects such as training and development, work-life balance, respect and inclusion, 
remuneration and benefits, and worker participation receive limited coverage \parencite{Greig2021}. While many large firms disclosed gender diversity data, such disclosures were often limited and 
linked to worse gender pay gaps, suggesting a reputational motive \parencite{Huang2022}.

\section{Sectoral Characteristics and Reporting Practices in Software Services}

\subsubsection{Paragraph 1: Sector Characteristics}
The software services sector is a service-based industry highly reliant on human capital and intangible assets.

\subsubsection{Paragraph 2: Reporting Practices in the Software Services}
Reporting practices in the software services sector are evolving, with firms increasingly recognizing 
the importance of social sustainability. However, many still struggle with effective implementation and measurement.

\section{Conceptualizations and Prior Approaches to Reporting Readiness}

\subsubsection{Paragraph 1: Definition of Reporting Readiness}
Reporting readiness refers to the extent to which an organization possesses the capacity, systems, data,
and commitment required to conduct high-quality, reliable SSR. Readiness incorporates both 
the existence of foundational elements and materiality (identification and prioritization of sector-relevant social topics).

\subsubsection{Paragraph 2: Prior Approaches to Reporting Readiness}

\subsubsection{1. Readiness frameworks in other sectors:}
Prior research in sectors such as Industry 4.0 \parencite{ElBaz2022}, 
green innovation \parencite{Zhang2020},
and sustainable manufacturing \parencite{Barletta2021} has widely applied readiness frameworks,
ranging from stage-based models to maturity-to-readiness adaptations, 
and in some cases structuring assessments around drivers and barriers \parencite{Govindan2023}.
However, these have not yet been used for SSR.

\subsubsection{2. Readiness/preparedness in CSR reporting:}
Prior research on CSR reporting has assessed readiness mainly through benchmarks 
such as ESRS and institutionalisation analyses rather than measuring readiness 
\parencite{Filho2025,Shabana2017}. 

\subsubsection{3. Measurement approaches:}
Measurement approaches in CSR reporting have primarily relied on scoring methods
aimed at compliance and performance rather than assessing readiness
\parencite{Tobias2022,Papoutsi2020,Gai2023,Nicolo2025}.

\subsubsection{4. CSR reporting readiness measurement with score-based approaches:}
Research on CSR reporting readiness is still limited, confined largely to the national level,
focused on ESG reporting in general  
and primarily employs scoring-based methods
\parencite{Nguyen2024,Montero2025}.

\subsubsection{5. Rationale for this study's approach:}
Given that SSR under ESRS/GRI is highly standardised and criteria-rich, 
a scoring-based approach is both feasible and enables transparent, reproducible readiness measurement.

\section{Literature-Based Drivers and Barriers}

\subsubsection{Paragraph 1: Drivers of Social Sustainability Reporting}
Drivers of social sustainability reporting include 
\begin{itemize}
    \item regulatory compliance, \parencite{Reitmaier2024,Bochkay2025}
    \item investor and client ESG expectations, \parencite{Bonnefon2025,Dai2021}
    \item reputation enhancement, \parencite{Reitmaier2024}
    \item benefits from CSR collaboration, \parencite{Dai2021}
    \item ethical practices and market valuation, \parencite{Chouaibi2021}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Paragraph 2: Barriers to Social Sustainability Reporting}
Barriers to social sustainability reporting encompass 
\begin{itemize}
    \item undefined industry-specific standards \parencite{Bochkay2025}
    \item limited data infrastructure and ESG systems \parencite{Troshani2024,ElBaz2022,Jona2023,Belal2015}
    \item stakeholder power asymmetries in B2B \parencite{Dai2021}
    \item symbolic reporting and greenwashing risk \parencite{Reitmaier2024,Belal2015}
    \item high costs and assurance expenses \parencite{Dai2021,Najjar2023}
\end{itemize}
