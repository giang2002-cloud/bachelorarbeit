\chapter{DISCUSSION ON EMPIRICAL RESULTS}

\section{Summary of Key Findings}
Brief recap of key results from Chapter 4:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Average SSR readiness among the 30 companies
    \item Strongest and weakest thematic categories
    \item Differences across company groups (by size, geography, etc.)
    \item Unexpected or counterintuitive observations
\end{itemize}

\section{Theoretical Interpretation of Results}
\subsection{Industry-Specific Challenges}

\begin{table}[H]

    \caption{Industry-Specific Challenges and Theoretical Interpretation}
    \begin{tabular}{p{6cm}|p{8cm}}
        \subsubsection{Challenge} & \subsubsection{Theoretical Interpretation} \\
        \hline
        Difficulty in collecting and standardizing non-financial data & RBV: Reflects lack of systems, tools, and personnelâ€”organizational capabilities not yet developed \\
        \hline
        Informal labor, globalization, remote work & Institutional Theory: Fragmented settings weaken legal coherence and coercive pressure \\
        \hline
        Lack of sector-specific social standards & Institutional Theory: Normative pressure is underdeveloped; no established "social norms" for the sector \\
        \hline
        SMEs lack ESG budget/personnel & RBV: SMEs often lack the strategic resources to build internal reporting capabilities
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Drivers of SSR Reporting}

\begin{table}[H]

    \caption{Drivers of SSR Reporting and Theoretical Interpretation}
    \begin{tabular}{p{6cm}|p{8cm}}
        \subsubsection{Driver} & \subsubsection{Theoretical Interpretation} \\
        \hline
        Regulatory pressure from CSRD, EFRAG, SEC & Institutional Theory: Coercive pressure driving behavioral change \\
        \hline
        Demands from customers and large investors & Stakeholder Theory: Stakeholder expectations incentivize transparency and reporting quality \\
        \hline
        Talent shortage $\rightarrow$ SSR used for employer branding & Stakeholder \& RBV: SSR becomes a competitive advantage in recruitment and reputation \\
        \hline
        Large firms with clear ESG leadership & RBV: Strong organizational capabilities, leadership, and ESG integration into strategy    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Implications for Practices}
\subsubsection{For Businesses}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SSR should be viewed not merely as compliance but as a strategic investment in long-term competitiveness \parencite{Barker2025}
    \item There is a need to improve the quality of reporting and avoid symbolic or superficial disclosures \parencite{Nava2023}
    \item SMEs may consider cost-sharing solutions: industry coalitions, standardized tools, and shared digital resources \parencite{Najjar2024}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{For Policymakers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop sector-specific SSR guidance, particularly for technology services
    \item Support SMEs through simplified tools, training, tax or financial incentives
    \item Promote open APIs and standardized formats (e.g., SRN) to enhance comparability and transparency
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{For Standard-Setters and Rating Agencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Refine social indicators tailored to the digital sector (e.g., DEI, personnel data protection)
    \item Clarify materiality thresholds to reduce ambiguity in reporting
\end{itemize}

\section{Academic Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extends ESG research into the software industry, a largely underexplored area
    \item Develops a transferable SSR readiness framework applicable to other service sectors
    \item Integrates three organizational theories in a complementary way to explain ESG reporting behavior
\end{itemize}
