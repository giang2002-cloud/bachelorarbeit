\section{Objectives}
The choice of 2023 as the temporal focus of this study is closely linked to the institutional context. 
While the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) formally entered into force in January 2023, 
companies are required to disclose in line with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) for 
fiscal years starting on or after January 2024. Thus, 2023 represented a preparatory phase in which firms 
faced rising institutional pressure, whereas 2024 marks the first mandatory reporting cycle. 
This transition reflects the increasing coercive institutional forces that shape companiesâ€™ readiness 
for social sustainability reporting.

Social pillars include employment, labor relations, diversity,
occupational health and safety, and human rights (Fiechter 2022; Edge 2022).
