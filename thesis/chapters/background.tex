\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Prior Literature on Social Sustainability Reporting}

Sustainability reporting can be understood under various definitions, 
including corporate social responsibility (CSR), extended external reporting, 
and ESG reporting \parencite{Edge2022}. As defined by \parencite{Rasche2017}, CSR is the integration of social, 
environmental, ethical, and philanthropic responsibilities into business practice. 
Similarly, the ESG framework focuses on environmental, social, and governance. 
Across these approaches, the social dimension consistently emerges as a core aspect,
covering issues such as employment, working conditions and human rights \parencite{Fiechter2022, Morais2018}.

Several regulations and standards have been developed to provide a basis for social sustainability reporting.
Among these, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is regarded as the most widely used framework 
by companies worldwide \parencite{Bais2024, vanOorschot2024}. 
According to GRI 401-406, companies disclose a wide range of social aspects, such as employment,
workplace conditions, equality issues and non-discrimination.
Marking a significant step forward, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) 
broaden this scope and make disclosure mandatory. The European Commission adopted the ESRS 
in July 2023 under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). These standards 
oblige companies to report on impacts concerning the workforce (S1), value chain workers (S2), 
affected communities (S3), and consumers and end-users (S4).

Despite these regulatory developments, prior studies show that the social pillar remains underdeveloped 
within sustainability reporting practices. According to \textcite{Heldal2024}, the social dimension 
has not received adequate attention. This can be explained by \textcite{Morais2018}, 
who argue that the social pillar remains vague, difficult to quantify, and less prioritized than 
environmental issues. This view is reinforced by \textcite{Berg2022}, who demonstrate lower inter-rater 
consensus on social indicators compared to environmental ones. These shortcomings point to limited 
preparedness for comprehensive social disclosures and raise the issue of reporting readiness.

\subsection{Prior Literature on SSR Readiness}
Most prior studies have addressed overall sustainability or CSR reporting readiness and compliance, 
but have not examined social pillar readiness in isolation. Previous studies have predominantly 
focused on the degree of compliance (GRI), which predates the ESRS 
and is regarded as the most widely adopted sustainability reporting standard worldwide. 
In general, sustainability reports tend to convey 
predominantly qualitative information, with only limited quantitative or monetary data \parencite{Michelon2015}.


At present, the introduction of the ESRS shifts attention toward firms' readiness to 
meet more comprehensive and mandatory reporting requirements. However, existing studies 
remain predominantly normative and conceptual, with limited empirical evidence 
on whether, and to what extent, firms have begun to adapt to the new sustainability 
reporting requirements. Notable exceptions are \textcite{Nicolo2025}, who examined early compliance with 
ESRS disclosure requirements among Italian listed firms and identified key firm-level drivers of 
adaptation, and \textcite{Filho2025}, who assessed the readiness of 20 firms drawn from a cross-sectoral 
sample of EU companies. \textcite{Nicolo2025} reports relatively high levels of early compliance 
with ESRS requirements among firms falling within the scope of the Omnibus Package. Whereas, 
\textcite{Raimo2025} documents relatively low overall levels of pre-compliance, 
particularly in integrated reports. \textcite{Filho2025} and \textcite{Montero2025} likewise reveal 
that disclosure, especially among SMEs, remains limited, due to the absence of concrete metrics, 
verification mechanisms, and external assurance. Overall, prior studies have focused on 
sustainability reporting in general and highlighted industry environmental sensitivity 
as a key determinant of readiness \parencite{Filho2025, Raimo2025, Nicolo2025, Montero2025}.



Overall, prior studies have predominantly 
concentrated on environmentally sensitive industries such as oil and energy \parencite{Filho2025, Raimo2025, Nicolo2025}, 
whereas the software sector has only been addressed within broader technology classifications \parencite{Montero2025}.


Reporting on key aspects such as work environment, work-life balance, 
and training is often inconsistent and rarely comprehensive \parencite{Greig2021}. Similarly,
disclosures on gender diversity were limited and linked to worse gender pay gaps,
suggesting a reputational motive \parencite{Huang2022}.

\section{Theoretical frameworks}

This study employs theoretical frameworks to explain the current level 
of social sustainability reporting readiness in the software services sector 
and to interpret the drivers and barriers shaping firms' preparedness.
Prior studies have highlighted the importance of theoretical perspectives 
in the study of sustainability reporting \parencite{Gesso2023, Rezaee2016, Lozano2015}.
Within the wide range of theories applied in this field, Institutional Theory
and Legitimacy Theory are among those frequently employed.

\subsection{Institutional Theory}
Institutional Theory is widely applied in sustainability 
reporting research \parencite{Campbell2007}. This theory explains 
how organizations adapt to social, political, and economic environments 
through institutionalized practices 
\parencite{Meyer1977, DiMaggio1983}.
It emphasizes how coercive, normative, and mimetic pressures shape organizational behavior.
